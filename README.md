Ocaml Problems for the Lsd Course at UPT

Here is a list of exercises you must be able to solve by yourselves for the LSD course.

You are free to use whatever resources you want and collaborate ins solving them. THe main thing is that you need yo understand in-depth how to solve these if you want to reliably pass the ocaml-problems on the LSD exam.

We have made attempts to simplify your work. We have added utility functions for cunstructing maps/ printing them.

We have written tests for each problem so you know when you've solved it.

Happ coding.
